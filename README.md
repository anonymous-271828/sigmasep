A significant part of the code is based on the code accompanying the following paper:

    @inproceedings{Hyttinen++2014,
      author    = {Hyttinen, A. and Eberhardt, F. and J{\"{a}}rvisalo, M.},
      title     = {Constraint-based Causal Discovery: Conflict Resolution with Answer Set Programming},
      booktitle = {Proceedings of the Thirtieth Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence, ({UAI}-14)},
      address   = {Quebec City, Quebec, Canada},
      pages     = {340--349},
      year      = {2014}
    }

## Getting started
The code isn't designed to run with one keystroke or be user-friendly. It should however
be helpful to reproduce the experiments reported in our paper, and as a starting point
for a more user-friendly implementation.

To reproduce the experiments reported in the paper, look into the python notebook 
`python/Experiments_and_Plotting.ipynb`
